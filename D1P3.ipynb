Every time an element is added it finds the hash value using hash(x) function and calculates an index value for storing it in the hash table. This allows searching through index and we can directly search for the index by using hash value and that's why set is faster than list.\n","   For a set:\n","      Best case: O(1) {Element is present at the first place}\n","      Average case: O(1) {Since we can access the element directly using the hash value}\n","      Worst case: O(n) {When the element does not exist in the set}\n","\"\"\""]}]}
